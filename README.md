This repository contains the code to implement the three basic classification algorithms seen in class: Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. In addition, we have included the file to scrape the required information from the bulk data download at [GovTrack.us](http://www.GovTrack.us). 

##Scraping the data
scrape_files.py is run with no arguments. You will need to change line 90 to your home directory. Also you should have run the bulk data download found [here](https://www.govtrack.us/developers/data) which will create the proper directory structure.

##Running K-Fold Validation

##asic Algorithms


##Contol File for basic algorithms

There are two scripts that can be run for k-fold cross validation- one with the subjects and one without.
